# GoAT

Go Auto Trader.

## Build and run

## First impressions of Go

As a seasoned C++ dev.

- It's certinaly not a pretty language
- Can't argue with doing https requests and JSON parsing in a few lines of code
- It's irritating your file doesn't compile if you don't use a header, I expect this is an option somewhere - _it is_

## Compiler options

```bash
-gcflags=all=-unusedresult=false
```
